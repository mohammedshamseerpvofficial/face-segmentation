# Advanced Face Detection and Emotion Analysis 🎭

I’m thrilled to share a new project I’ve been working on—a drag-and-drop web application that takes face detection to the next level! 🌟

## 📌 Features:
- ✔️ **Drag & Drop**: Upload images seamlessly.
- ✔️ **Face Detection**: Automatically detects all faces in the uploaded image.
- ✔️ **Face Segmentation**: Crops and displays each detected face individually.
- ✔️ **Emotion Analysis**: Identifies the emotion for each face and shows it in a dynamic table.

This tool is designed to make facial analysis simple, accurate, and accessible. Perfect for developers, researchers, or anyone curious about AI-powered image processing! 💡
