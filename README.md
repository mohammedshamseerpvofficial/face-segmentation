# Advanced Face Detection and Emotion Analysis ðŸŽ­

I am pleased to present a new project focused on advanced face detection and emotion analysis. This drag-and-drop web application leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to provide seamless and accurate facial recognition, segmentation, and emotion analysis from user-uploaded images.

## Key Features:
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Upload images with ease through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface.
- **Automatic Face Detection**: The application automatically detects and highlights all faces within the uploaded image.
- **Face Segmentation**: Each detected face is cropped and displayed individually for focused analysis.
- **Emotion Analysis**: The system analyzes each face and identifies the corresponding emotion, which is displayed in an interactive table.

This tool is designed to make facial analysis simple, accurate, and accessible. It is an ideal solution for researchers, developers, and professionals interested in AI-powered image processing.
